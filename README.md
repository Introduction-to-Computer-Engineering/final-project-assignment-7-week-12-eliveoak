#### Part 2

I added my screensaver to the basic program from the breakout board guide, and changed the pins from P6, P8, and P9 to P8, P12, and P16 
respectively. I used my screensaver in lieu of the string.

#### Part 3

I have my screensaver playing and when one part of the animation plays, it lights up an LED. Then it turns off the Previous LED, and when
the next part of the animation plays, it lights up the second LED and so on.
