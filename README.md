#### Part 2

I added my screensaver to the basic program from the breakout board guide, and changed the pins from P6, P8, and P9 to P8, P12, and P16 
respectively. I used my screensaver in lieu of the string.

#### Part 3

I have my screensaver playing and when one part of the animation plays, it lights up an LED. Then it turns off the Previous LED, and when
the next part of the animation plays, it lights up the second LED and so on.

# Soil Sensor

#### Part 1

### Part i

This is a basic program that reads an open GPIO pin and lights the LEDS when it detects that the input turns on.

### Part iv

We created a program that automatically takes readings of the sensor and then averages them to create a solid baseline reading.
Then, it takes a new reading and uses the baseline of the averages to then plot a graph on the micro:bit of the reading.
High is top and Low is bottom
